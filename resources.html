                    Fiat money is government-issued currency that isn't backed by a physical commodity like gold. Its value is based entirely on trust in the government. Examples include the US Dollar, Euro, and Pound. Unlike Bitcoin, fiat currencies can be printed endlessly, often leading to inflation.
