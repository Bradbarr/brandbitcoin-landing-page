      <h2>Why Bitcoin Matters</h2>
      <p>
        You're not just learning about a new type of money — you're witnessing the rise of something extraordinary. Bitcoin is not controlled by any government or bank. It’s a global, volunteer-driven movement. An open network. A peaceful revolution. And you're invited.
      </p>
      <p>
        At BrandBitcoin, we’re not here to sell you hype. We're here to walk with you through your questions, your concerns, your curiosity. Whether you’re just starting or ready to go deeper, we’re here to help you understand why so many believe Bitcoin is one of the most important technologies of our time.

  <!-- What’s Wrong With Today’s Money -->

      <h2>The Problem With Today's Money</h2>
      <p>
        Modern currency – the money in your wallet or bank – is no longer backed by anything real, like gold. It’s created endlessly by governments and central banks. Over time, this drains your purchasing power. Quietly. Predictably. Historically, all such currencies have failed. It's a pattern that's repeated throughout human history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitcoin offers an alternative. A digital form of money that can’t be inflated, frozen, or seized. It’s not just new — it’s better. It’s built to protect you.

    <div class="container">
      <h2>What Makes Bitcoin So Powerful?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> No central authority. No government can shut it down or change the rules unilaterally.</li>
        <li><strong>Scarce:</strong> Only 21 million will ever exist. You can't print more.</li>
        <li><strong>Borderless:</strong> Send value across the globe in minutes, without permission.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure:</strong> Backed by the most powerful computer network on Earth.</li>
        <li><strong>Owned by the people:</strong> Run by individuals, not institutions. Maintained by volunteers worldwide.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This isn’t just money. It’s freedom, encrypted.
