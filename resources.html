                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(1)">What is Fiat Money?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer" id="answer-1">
                    Fiat money is government-issued currency that isn't backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver. Its value comes from the trust people place in the government that issues it. Examples include the US Dollar, Euro, and British Pound. Unlike Bitcoin, fiat money can be printed indefinitely, which can lead to inflation.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">How Does Bitcoin Differ from Traditional Money?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer" id="answer-2">
                    Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning no single entity (like a government or bank) controls it. It operates on a blockchain, a public ledger that records all transactions. Unlike traditional money, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it immune to inflation caused by overprinting.

            <!-- FAQ 3 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">What Gives Bitcoin Its Value?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer" id="answer-3">
                    Bitcoin's value comes from its scarcity, utility, and the trust people place in it. Like gold, Bitcoin is scarce (only 21 million will ever exist). Itâ€™s also useful as a decentralized, borderless currency and a store of value. The more people adopt it, the more valuable it becomes.
