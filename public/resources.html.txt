            <!-- FAQ 1 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="dropdown-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(1)">
                    What is Fiat Money?
                    <span class="arrow">▼</span>
                </button>
                <div class="dropdown-answer" id="answer-1">
                    Fiat money is government-issued currency that isn't backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver. Its value comes from the trust people place in the government that issues it. Examples include the US Dollar, Euro, and British Pound. Unlike Bitcoin, fiat money can be printed indefinitely, which can lead to inflation.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ 2 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="dropdown-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">
                    How Does Bitcoin Differ from Traditional Money?
                    <span class="arrow">▼</span>
                </button>
                <div class="dropdown-answer" id="answer-2">
                    Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning no single entity (like a government or bank) controls it. It operates on a blockchain, a public ledger that records all transactions. Unlike traditional money, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it immune to inflation caused by overprinting.

            </div>

            <!-- FAQ 3 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="dropdown-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">
                    What Gives Bitcoin Its Value?
                    <span class="arrow">▼</span>
                </button>
                <div class="dropdown-answer" id="answer-3">
                    Bitcoin's value comes from its scarcity, utility, and the trust people place in it. Like gold, Bitcoin is scarce (only 21 million will ever exist). It’s also useful as a decentralized, borderless currency and a store of value. The more people adopt it, the more valuable it becomes.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ 4 -->

                    What is the Blockchain?
                    <span class="arrow">▼</span>
                </button>
                <div class="dropdown-answer" id="answer-4">
                    The blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner. It’s composed of blocks that contain transaction data, and each block is linked to the previous one, ensuring data integrity and security.
